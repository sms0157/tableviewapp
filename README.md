# tableviewapp
This app is made to showcase the table view controller. There are 10 cells of cat breeds. Once clicked, an image of the cat is shown, as well as a little bit of information on the breed. There is also a back button in the segues for landscape mode. This app should work in all screen sizes and orientations.
